      </Ul>

      <H2>5. Security Responsibility</H2>

        Because wolfXbase is self-hosted, <Highlight>you are entirely responsible</Highlight> for the security of your

      <H2>6. Data Ownership</H2>
      <P>
        All data stored in your wolfXbase instance remains <Highlight>entirely yours</Highlight>. WOLF TECH has no
        access to your data, your server, or your MongoDB databases. We do not collect any telemetry, analytics, or
        usage data from self-hosted installations.

      <H2>7. No Warranty</H2>
      <P>

        Use of the software is entirely at your own risk.
      </P>

      <H2>8. Limitation of Liability</H2>
      <P>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, WOLF TECH and Silent Wolf shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from your use of, or inability to use,
        wolfXbase — including but not limited to data loss, data breach, service interruption, or loss of revenue.
      </P>

      <H2>9. Third-Party Software</H2>
